                Adam Goldberg is an Emmy, Clio, and Peabody Award winning
                Producer/Director living in Marina del Rey, CA. The South
                Carolina native has continued to ride the wave of sports
                documentaries and feature films. His credit list includes
                groundbreaking series and name brands: ESPN’s 30 for 30, HBO
                24/7, “Losers” on Netflix, The Masters, and the Pepsi Super Bowl
                Halftime Show. He has also found a nice balance between
                freelance Showrunning and Directing docs, and commercial/branded
                endeavors through South District Films, which he founded in
                2013.

                Jr., embedded with Manny Pacquiao, trekked the Sahara with an
                ultra-marathoner, and shot intimate rehearsals with Dr. Dre and
